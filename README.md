# Modern Tools in AIML Workshop - Instruction Material

Welcome to the "Modern Tools in AIML" workshop hosted by the Mozilla Campus Club CRCE! This repository contains the materials you'll need for the hands-on session and demonstrations during the event. We're excited to explore the fascinating world of neural networks and their applications.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, we'll journey through the core concepts of neural networks, explore the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis, and dive into the magic of transfer learning using pretrained models. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of modern tools in AI/ML and how to apply them effectively.

## Contents

-   `datasets/`: A directory containing sample datasets for our hands-on exercises. The dataset is also available on Kaggle: [Download Dataset](https://kaggle.com/datasets/1a8afd70f74fb9af25decec9154b9bbf86aa170dd6df80841d4078f79e68669c).
-   `supplements/`: Code snippets and example scripts used during the demonstrations.
-   `resources.md`: A curated list of additional resources, tutorials, and references to help you continue your AI/ML learning journey.

## Get Started

At the beginning of the workshop, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Git installed on your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the workshop materials.
4. Clone this repository using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/neavepaul/MozillaTalkML.git
    ```

5. Once the repository is cloned, you'll have access to all the necessary materials.

We're thrilled to dive into the world of neural networks and transfer learning with you. Let's master these modern tools and unleash their potential together!

Happy learning,  
Neave Paul
